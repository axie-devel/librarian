<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="intitle">Dear readers!</h2>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="paragraph">It is our great pleasure to present you the “Future of Copyright 
Anthology”, a collection of 10 best short stories sent in for the “Future 
of Copyright” contest organized by Modern Poland Foundation. These works 
have been selected by our jury – Prof. Michael Geist, Piotr Czerski and 
Jarosław Lipszyc.</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="paragraph">The main prize in this contest was founded by you, the readers, on the 
Indiegogo crowdfunding platform. We are proud to announce that this 
prize goes to Aymeric Mansoux, author of “Morphology of a copyright 
tale”, in appreciation of the originality, power and the strong message 
of this work. Moreover, the jury decided to grant an honorable mention 
to Togi, author of the work “Give”.</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="paragraph">We would like to thank you for your crowdfunding support and a high
standard of the submitted works. We were pleasantly surprised by the
interest shown in the competition, and we have decided to hold
its second edition next 
year. We hope that with your help it will be even more successful and 
the collected works will provide a strong voice in the debate on the future 
of copyright law and system.</p>
