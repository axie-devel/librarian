<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="intitle">Dear readers!</h2>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="paragraph">It is our great pleasure to present the anthology of the second edition of the Future of Copyright Contest organized by Modern Poland Foundation. <br/>These works have been selected by our jury: Beatriz Busaniche (Via Libre Foundation, Wikimedia Argentina, University of Buenos Aires), Shun-Ling Chen (University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law), Mike Linksvayer (Creative Commons, OpenHatch and Software Freedom Conservanc, Open Definition Advisory Council) Joe McNamee (EDRi), Jérémie Zimmermann (La Quadrature du Net) and Jarosław Lipszyc (Modern Poland Foundation).</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="paragraph"> We are proud to announce that the first prize goes to <wyroznienie>Talllama</wyroznienie>, the author of <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A Penny for Your Thoughts</i> As our jurors noticed:</p>


<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="paragraph"><i>"it is engagingly written and fun to read transposition of exactly today's copyright and debates (including  wild mischaracterization) into a future with mind uploading. The idea of having all our thoughts fixed and therefore protected by copyright is a smart way of showing how ridiculous the current situation is."</i></p>


<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="paragraph">Talllama and all competitors - thank you for your contribution to the copyright debate.</p>


<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="paragraph">We also would like to thank all for crowd-funding support and funding the prize for the winner via the <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/future-of-copyright-contest-2-0">Indiegogo</a> platform.</p>


<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="paragraph">The picture used on the cover is a remix based on Leonardo da Vinci's <tytul_dziela>Lady with an Ermine</tytul_dziela> and Johannes Vermeer's <tytul_dziela>Girl with a Pearl Earring</tytul_dziela> (remix by Radek Czajka, license: CC-BY-SA). The Modern Poland Foundation was involved in the discussion with the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage about the rights to use the image and the name of da Vinci's painting. Although <tytul_dziela>Lady with an Ermine</tytul_dziela> was painted even before the creation of the idea of copyright and is in the public domain since the moment when it started to function, one of the Polish foundations wanted to sell the rights to this painting. The Modern Poland Foundation publicly defended the right to re-use and remix this work of art.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="paragraph">Enjoy!</p>
