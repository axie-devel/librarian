                    <div class="p">It was late at night and Smartie the Penguin was 
WIDE awake... He was supposed to be fast asleep 
but tomorrow was his birthday. He was so 
excited; all he wanted was a new computer! </div>

                    <div class="p">The big day came and Smartie had really enjoyed 
his birthday party. He had saved his biggest and 
most exciting looking present until the very end, 
“Oh please, please, please!” he thought as he 
began to open it.</div>

wrapping paper in a hurry, 
it was exactly what he 
wanted, a brand new 
laptop!</div>

you, thank you, 
thank you!” He 
cried.</div>

                    <div class="p">Daddy Penguin was 
extremely clever and 
knew all about 
computers and how to 
get on to the internet. 
He helped Smartie to 
find his favourite 
website and soon 
Smartie was happily 
playing a game online.</div>
